                        Self-driving cars, also known as autonomous cars, are vehicles that do not require human interaction.
                        This is due to the car relying on sensors, machine learning systems, cameras, lidar, hardware, software, radar and artificial intelligence to sense the environment it is in.

                    <li>For example, positive benefits such as a reduction of crash rates. The US expect a 90% reduction, which ultimately could allow a potential $180 billion to be saved each year in health care & automotive maintenance.</li>

                    <li>
                        There are many benefits that self-driving cars have such as safe roads, being environmentally friendly, minimize traffic congestion, reduced risk of crashes, therefore, saving lives.
                        Therefore, it will have an impact on society and how individuals will live in the future. According to WHO, 20-50 million individuals come away with non-fatal injuries and 1.35 million lose their lives every year due to traffic accidents.
                        Self-driving cars will be able to reduce these figures
