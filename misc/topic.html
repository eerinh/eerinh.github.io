    <h1>Self-Driving Cars - The Way Of The Future</h1>

    <h2>What are self-driving cars?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Self-driving cars, also known as autonomous cars, are vehicles that do not require human interaction. 
        This is due to the car relying on sensors, machine learning systems, cameras, lidar, hardware, software, radar and artificial intelligence to sense the environment it is in. </li>
        <li>There are different levels of autonomous vehicle technology. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why are these cars important?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Self-driving cars are slowly becoming the future of transportation and it is important to understand the different impacts that they have on society and individuals</li>
        <li>For example, positive benefits such as a reduction of crash rates. The US expect a 90% reduction, which ultimately could allow a potential $180 billion to be saved each year in health care & automotive maintenance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Why we chose this topic?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>To see how these cars will impact individuals (trust & ethics involved) and how they will impact the future of transportation in society. </li>
        <li>There are many benefits that self-driving cars have such as safe roads, being environmentally friendly, minimize traffic congestion, reduced risk of crashes, therefore, saving lives. 
        Therefore, it will have an impact on society and how individuals will live in the future. According to WHO, 20-50 million individuals come away with non-fatal injuries and 1.35 million lose their lives every year due to traffic accidents. 
        Self-driving cars will be able to reduce these figures</li>
    </ul>
