    <h1>Technology Risks</h1>


    <h4><p>The page or area describing the risks posed by your chosen technology/topic.</p></h4>


    <p>
      Along with many opportunities that self-driving cars provide, there are potential risks that can arise. <br><br>
      One of the biggest impacts is job loss which will have an impact on many individuals. Job loss can affect individuals who rely on their cars to get their job done. This could be those who are driving instructors, taxi drivers, uber drivers or truck drivers. Their work will be replaced by automated cars, resulting in them losing their job.  There is already a shortage of drivers in this area. David Cole, director-emeritus of the Center for Automotive Research, states that the shortage of drivers is a great opportunity for the development of autonomous vehicles. 
      <br><br>
      There is also a risk for the auto industry. According to the US department of Labour, 884,000 people are involved in the vehicle and parts manufacturing industry, 3.02 million are involved in car dealers and the automotive maintenance industry, along with 6 million being professional automobile drives. In the next 10 to 15 years there is a potential 10million individuals who will lose their job. Therefore, the decrease in car owners will have an impact on both the auto industry and the employment of individuals. With these figures being only inside the United States, we can expect these numbers to be larger across the world.   
      <br><br>
      The cost of insurance will decline. This will be due to the decrease in road accidents involving cars and pedestrians. According to McKinsey an analysis, the demand for auto insurance will be reduced. By 2040, the auto insurance market may shrink by more than 80%.  
      <br><br>
      Another risk is the lack of security. This will have an impact on the individuals using self-driving cars. Autonomous vehicles are highly vulnerable and can be exposed to hacking by accessing information traffic, GPS information and controlling data, all of which could result in accidents, kidnappings or murder (Zhanxiang Chai et al, 2020). Dailey (2018) explains how the self-driving car can be hacked then reprogramed to change the destination which will result in a kidnapping. This could cause individuals to feel unsafe or anxious while using these types of cars. Bimbraw (2015) states that there are also potential risks for increased criminal or terrorist attacks. This is because individuals who are planning these attacks do not have to put themselves in any danger and have the chance of not being caught.  
      <br><br>
      Autonomous driving also relates to lack of privacy. Whenever used by a person a large amount of private and personal information is collected.  Automakers can have access to data about the owner and their family such as their daily schedules, their age. It can also have sensible information relevant about their life, for example, where they went on a specific day or which supermarket they used to shop (Zhanxiang Chai et al, 2020).
