    <h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>

    </ul><h4><p>The page or area describing the opportunities presented by your chosen technology/topic.<p></h4>
      <p>There is an opportunity to make self-driving cars electric at the same time. Coppola and Esztergár-Kiss (2019) discusses the idea that currently one of the main draw backs of electric cars is their battery life and part of this is how they are driven. By making electric cars self-driving you control the driving of the vehicle therefore increasing the vehicles range between charges. This not only gives a greater drive distance but also lower emissions. Coppola and Esztergár-Kiss (2019) goes on to discuss how by making electric cars self-driving with advanced braking systems and controlled rates of propulsion there are great environmental benefits to be made due to increased efficiencies. <br><br>

        Bobisse and Andrea (2019) discuss the idea of making self-driving cars or as referred by Bobisse and Andrea (2019) CAVs (connected autonomous vehicles) he addresses that for them to be at their most efficient as electric vehicles, there is an idea of also making the city electric or connected. Therefore, the cars are connected to the city and traffic can flow at maximum efficiencies. One note Bobisse and Andrea (2019) make is that for it to be beneficial to change to electricity with CAVs, they will also need to change to renewable energy otherwise the environmental impact will have next to no change, which is an interesting point made. However, there is still the potential opportunity for a lot of environmental improvement due to self-driving cars also being electric. As neither the electric car market nor the self-driving car market is likely to have the push to get consumers across the line, however, if they are getting the benefits of both, it is seen as a much larger opportunity too. <br><br> 
        
        Another opportunity Self-driving cars can provide is reducing the number of injuries and accidents that occur on the road each year. The number of car crashes that happen each year has an impact on society due to financial and economic costs. According to Bertoncello and Wee (2015), the US economy was impacted by $212 billion dollars in 2012 due to the overall annual cost of roadway crashes. According to National Highway Safety Administration (2015), 94% of all traffic accidents were directly or indirectly responsible for traffic accidents due to driver error.  With self-driving cars, the autonomous system will allow for a faster reaction time and increased reliability compared to humans, therefore allowing the opportunity to reduce the number of crashes on the road each year.
