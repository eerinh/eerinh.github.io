<h1>Erin Ethics</h1>

<p> Self-driving cars will no doubt have a profound impact on transportation in the future. They will have the potential to impact society and individuals as well as there being numerous possibilities of how these autonomous cars will change our future for the better. However, with this being said, there are many questions that surround this topic. Ethics help individuals make decisions based on what is right or wrong. Self-driving cars pose ethical and moral dilemmas in society. A common dilemma is what if a self-driving car is driving when a group of 3 children run across the road at a pedestrian crossing without looking. The self-driving car does not have enough time to brake which would ultimately cause the car to crash into the children. However, with human driver error out of the equation, it is up to the car to make this decision. Should the self-driving car continue to go straight which will kill the lives of these three children or should the self-drivng car swerve causing it to crash into a building resulting in the death of the individual in the self-driving car? Therefore, the issue raised is how will the self-driving car choose between the two. From a human perspective, we are able to use our moral compass to determine what the self-driving car would do. Do you save the lives of three young children who are just starting their life or save the passenger in the car that was not responsible for the crash. Either way, lives will be lost it will just depend on how many. How will the car be programmed to deal with these situations? <br><br>
	
Personally, I found the topic of self-driving cars fascinating. Before investigating this topic, I did not have a deep understanding of cars or autonomous technology due to not having to drive. However, learning about the opportunities, risks and choices that self-driving cars have allowed me to gain an insight into how they work and the world of autonomous technology. After researching this topic, I believe the most important part of this safety. When self-driving cars become more profound on the roads, I would like to know that the car I am in is as safe as possible as well as the other cars around me. In the future, I believe that these cars will have an impact on us and our day to day lives. As we speak, there are already developments to create a new suburb in New Zealand that is car less. Instead, they will use self-driving busses to travel around their suburb. Although, they may not be cars they still provide the same purpose. I strongly believe that this is a snippet into what our future holds. <br><br>
Overall, Self-driving cars will positively impact society. Like anything, there will also be challenges that will arise. Before we see a society of these cars, I recommended that all prototypes be tested in possible situations that they could end up in. This is to see how they would respond and then make any changes to ensure that they are as safe as possible for public use. I also think that these cars should be trialled in smaller suburbs before entering into large cities to ensure everything runs smoothly. I also highly recommend the importance of education surrounding this topic. It is important for society to be aware of these cars, as we will be sharing the roads with them or be utilising them. There should be simple safety instructions or videos for users to read/watch. Self-driving cars provide exciting new opportunities for society. As self-driving cars continue to develop, I look forward to what the future holds for them.
