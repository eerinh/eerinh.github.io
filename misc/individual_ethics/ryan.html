<h1>Ethical Issues</h1>

	<p>
		Ethics is the set of principles about what is right and wrong that individuals use 
		to make choices to guide their decision.
		One of the ethical issues that encounter about self-driving car is, when the program 
		controls the vehicle and the brake car is broken, who is going to save the drive and 
		the passenger which is a man, a big woman, and a child or the pedestrians and a dog. 
		The program cannot make moral decision by taking the live.

		<br>
		Another is,  if a car accident has occurred between the driven and pedestrian, who 
		will be responsible for this fault. In this condition, it is possible that the 
		program has a failure of misunderstanding object and people.
		In these scenarios, the moral responsibility is involved. Some live will be lost 
		whenever they choose between the passenger or the pedestrians.

	</p>


	<h1>Reflections</h1>

	<p>
		I presume that new technologies will have a strongly impact in our society in 
		particular autonomous vehicle. In my opinion, the autonomous vehicles are not 
		ready to be on sale.
		It will improve our lifestyle and bring many advantages in the social, 
		environmental and health side. It has also many disadvantages such as privacy, 
		automobile insurance, ethics, safety, and hacking.
		Autonomous vehicles have a bright side that will change the way we live. 
		However, The machine or not as smart as human, they are not able to decide 
		by them self. The programmers have programmed them in a good way.
