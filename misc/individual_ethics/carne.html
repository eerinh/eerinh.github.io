    <h1>Carne Ethics</h1>

    <div>
        According to Aldinhas et al. (2019) there are currently debates between what is known as the utilitarian vehicle and Immanual Kants duty bound vehicle.
        To give context, a utilitarian vehicle will always make the decision that takes the least number of lives.
        Whereas a duty bound vehicleï¿½s main purpose is to protect the passengers of the vehicle. A scenario discussed by Aldinhas et al. (2019)
        is you are in a self driving car and are the only passenger. There are six pedestrians. 
        The only way to avoid the six pedestrians is to swerve however if the car swerves it hits a wall most likely to kill the passenger (you).
        A utilitarian approach is to save as many lives as possible therefore the car swerves and hits the wall killing the passenger. 
        However this punishes a person for owning a self driving car as it means they are putting their lives at risk to protect others.
        A duty bound vehicle would continue driving and hit the 6 pedestrians possible killing them but keeping you safe.
        Which brings the next argument of if this is the case is their punishment for this as the vehicle has been programmed to hit pedestrians even though it was avoidable?<br />

        Personally, if I were buying a car, I would want to know I was safe, 
        however this has raised a moral and ethical issue for myself as I have always thought I was utilitarian.
        It turns out it might be easier to tell others to make decisions with the least impact on life than it is to do. 
        The ethical issues around self-driving cars are an interesting topic, I have attached a short video that further elaborates some of the ethical debates.
